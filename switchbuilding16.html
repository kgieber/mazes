			<p>Next, try building something whimsical. All you need are objects that can conduct electricity and some imagination. Here's one that was built using metal springs, aluminum foil, lollipop sticks and styrofoam balls:</p>
			<img src="images/switches/lollipop_switches.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="A base containing six lollipop sticks with colored styrofoam balls on top. The lollipop sticks are inside six vertical springs attached to the base." />
			<p></p>
			<img src="images/switches/lollipop_side.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Side view of the lollipop stick switches shows a board behind the springs, but not touching them. The board is covered with aluminum foil and when the stick is pushed back, the spring comes in contact with the aluminum foil. Wires from each of the springs are attached to six posts and another post is mounted so that it is touching the aluminum foil."/>
