			<h2>What’s a Switch?</h2>
			<p>Switches are found everywhere. A <a href="glossary.html#def-switch">switch</a> allows you to change from one thing to another. For example, you can switch a train from one track to another or you can switch your light on or off. In some cases, you can switch between more than one option, like an <a href="glossary.html#def-electric">electric</a> fan which could go fast, medium or slow.</p>
			<h2>How Does a Basic Circuit Work?</h2>
			<p>For an <a href="glossary.html#def-circuit">electric circuit</a> to work, current has to flow in a circle from positive to negative. Take a look at a <a href="glossary.html#def-battery">battery</a>. You will see a positive (+) side and a negative (-) side. To power a light, one side is connected to the positive side of the battery and the other is connected to the negative side. When both sides are connected, the light goes on.</p>

			<p>When there’s a break in the circuit the light goes off.</p>
			<img src="images/switches/light_off.jpg" width="600" height="402" alt="A battery holder with two batteries has two wires. One is black and the other is red. The black one is connected to a wire on a light, but the red one is not. The light is off." />
