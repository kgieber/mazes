			<h2>How Does a Basic Circuit Work? (continued)</h2>
			<p>In this circuit, the wires are connected to two posts with a gap in between. When there is nothing between the gap, the <a href="glossary.html#def-current">current</a> cannot flow and the light remains off.</p>
			<img src="images/switches/circuit_off.jpg" width="800" height="490" alt="A battery holder with two batteries has two wires. One is black and the other is red. The red one is connected to a wire on a light, but the black one from the light goes to one metal post. The black wire from the batteries goes to another nearby metal post. The light is off."/>
			<p>Since electric current flows through metal objects, we can put a paper clip between the two posts and the light will turn on.</p>
