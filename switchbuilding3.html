			<h2>How Does a Switch Work In a Circuit?</h2>
			<p>Most basic switches work with two pieces of metal. When the switch is in the off position, the pieces of metal are apart, but when the switch is in the on position, the two pieces of metal touch allowing the current to flow across them.</p>
			<h2>Example</h2>
			<p>This switch has two pieces of aluminum foil inside. When the switch is pressed down the two pieces of foil touch and the circuit is closed.</p>

The red wire of the switch is attached to one of the posts and the black wire is attached to the other. The is being pressed and the light is on." />
			<p>When the switch is released the two pieces of foil are apart and the light goes off, since electricity is not able to flow.</p>
